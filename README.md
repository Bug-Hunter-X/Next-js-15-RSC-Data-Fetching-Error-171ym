# Next.js 15 RSC Data Fetching Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered in Next.js 15 related to React Server Components (RSC) and data fetching.  The issue manifests as an unclear error message when attempting to fetch data within an RSC and render it on the client.  The solution involves carefully managing data fetching and component rendering to ensure compatibility with RSC.

## Bug Description

The core problem lies in how data is fetched and used in conjunction with RSC. The original code resulted in an error likely stemming from asynchronous operations within the RSC and timing issues related to hydration. The error itself might not pinpoint the exact cause effectively, leading to difficulty in debugging.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the error in the browser's console.
